The "web_map.py" module creates a web map "map.html" showing the countries' population and locations where movies of given year were filmed.

Used html tags:
<*!DOCTYPE*> - type of the document;
<*head*> - technical information about the document;
<*meta*> - provides metadata about the document;
<*script*> - defines a client-side script;
<*link*> - link between a document and an external resource;
<*style*> - information about the style of the document;
<*body*> - body of the document;
<*div*> - part of the document.

Map created by this module shows us which countries made movies in certain year.
